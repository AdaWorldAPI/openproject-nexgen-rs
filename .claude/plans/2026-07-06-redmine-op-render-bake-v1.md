# Redmine/OP render bake v1 — AR/Rails views → ClassView×FieldMask → askama/jinja

> **Type:** plan + PRE-REGISTRATION (thresholds written BEFORE the first
> measurement run — the F17/C5 discipline).
> **Status:** PLANTED 2026-07-06, fleet in flight (ERB extractor · OP recon ·
> render-kit join design).
> **Thesis:** a Rails view is *detected config* (fuzzy-recipe-codebook §8c):
> it bakes to DATA — a `(class, field-set)` mask — never to hand-transcribed
> templates. The dual-target render (askama Rust / jinja Python, falsifier #2,
> OGAR #158) then re-emits both skins from the mask. If Redmine views and OP
> representers of the same concept project to overlapping masks, "routes are
> skins" stops being doctrine and becomes measurement.

## PRE-REGISTERED metrics + thresholds (2026-07-06, before any run)

1. **Mask coverage** — fraction of `receiver.ident` references in views that
   resolve to harvested canonical fields.
   - ≥ 60% → the ERB surface is mask-shaped; the bake stands.
   - 30–60% → partial: bake ships with the uncovered-reference census as the
     finding (helpers/computed surface = the render-side jitter codebook).
   - < 30% → KILL: views are not field-projections; the bake claim is regraded.
2. **Dual-target parity** — for every baked (class, mask), the askama field set
   MUST equal the jinja field set. Threshold: **100%** (deterministic
   machinery; any mismatch is a bug in the kit, not tolerance).
3. **Mask-reuse ratio** — distinct masks per class ÷ views referencing that
   class. < 0.5 supports the Scope/route-dedup SoC claim (many views, few
   masks); ≈ 1.0 refutes it (every view its own mask — skins are NOT shared).

Tail discipline: any view whose field-set maps to NO harvested field is
excluded and counted (never silently dropped); the uncovered-reference
histogram is published with the bake.

## Legs

- **Leg 1 (this session): Redmine ERB** — 506 views local/in-scope; models via
  `extract_app_with_schema` (fixed walker). Measured leg.
- **Leg 2: OP representers** — modern OP is Angular+APIv3; the field surface
  lives in `*_representer.rb`/schema declarations, not ERB. Same
  `(class, field-set)` reduction; grammar per the recon agent. May land as a
  follow-up if the declaration surface needs its own extractor.
- **Convergence measurement (the point):** shared-mask overlap between
  Redmine-`Issue` views and OP-`WorkPackage` representers via the C4 rename
  table — the render-side sibling of C5's shared-RecipeConceptId collapse.
  NOT pre-registered yet: needs leg 2's grammar first; register before running.

## Fleet (model policy: grindwork=Sonnet, accumulation=Opus)

- A1 Sonnet — `ruff_ruby_spo::views` extractor (std-only, closed-vocab,
  word-boundary; presence-only per C2).
- A2 Sonnet — OP corpus recon (direct-token clone; ERB count, representer
  grammar, verbatim samples).
- A3 Opus — render-kit join design (mask width gaps, jinja runtime, canonical
  order source, artifact schema) → `bake-design.md`.
- Orchestrator — assembles the probe in `crates/ruff_openproject/tests/`,
  runs leg 1, pins drift fuses, parks the bake, PRs.

## PRE-REGISTERED — leg 2 (OP representers) + CONV-1 (2026-07-06, before any leg-2 run)

Unblocked by: OGAR #163 merged (`render_class_with_methods_wide` — the
born use-case is `work_packages` at >64 columns) + ruff #46 merged
(`extract_representer_field_sets`). Corpus: `/tmp/op-corpus` (OpenProject,
228 `*_representer.rb` under `lib/api/v3`, OP-layout `db/migrate/tables/`).

- **L2-E1 representer coverage** — per representer: |resolved fields| /
  |declared properties| against the harvested model basis (same honest
  denominator as leg 1). Same bars for comparability: median ≥ 0.60 stands ·
  0.30–0.60 partial (uncovered census ships as the finding — expected shape:
  computed/link properties with no column) · < 0.30 KILL (assert).
  Note: representers are a *declarative* surface — if this leg lands BELOW
  the ERB leg's 0.667, that itself is a finding to publish, not to smooth.
- **L2-E2 dual-target parity incl. the WIDE leg** — EXACTLY 1.00 (assert).
  Wide classes (>64 fields) render via `render_class_with_methods_wide`
  against the same bit-walk oracle; jinja witness gets the mask as a hex
  string (`int(x,16)` — Python bigint carries 256 bits natively).
- **CONV-1 — the point of the whole bake:** shared-field overlap between
  the Redmine-`Issue` view masks (leg 1 artifact) and the OP-`WorkPackage`
  representer masks, through the C4 rename seed (committed WITH this
  pre-registration, BEFORE the run — hand-seeded from known Redmine→OP
  migrations history: `tracker_id→type_id`, `fixed_version_id→version_id`,
  `created_on→created_at`, `updated_on→updated_at`, identity elsewhere).
  Metric: Jaccard of the two unions-of-present-fields after rename.
  - ≥ 0.50 → convergence stands ("routes are skins" holds ACROSS apps).
  - 0.25–0.50 → partial: publish the disjoint-field census (the C4 gap
    list IS the deliverable — it seeds the full rename table).
  - < 0.25 → refuted at the field level; the claim regrades to
    per-app-only and the disjoint census explains why.
  Informational (not gated): exact shared-mask count after rename; the
  per-side unmatched-field lists.

Tail discipline: representers whose properties resolve to NO harvested
column are excluded from parity but counted in the census — never
silently dropped.

## Run log

- **Run 1 (2026-07-06): VOID — harvest-layout gap, not a KILL.** The E1 gate
  fired at median 0.000 because `extract_app_with_schema` reads only the
  OP-layout baseline (`db/migrate/tables/*.rb`); Redmine ships classic
  migrations, so `Model.fields` came back empty and the basis carried no DB
  columns — the measurement was views-vs-a-columnless-basis, i.e. invalid,
  and the KILL assert did exactly its job (loud on a broken join). The
  pre-registered thresholds stand unchanged for run 2. Fix in flight: a
  classic-migration fallback in the ruff schema reader (create_table blocks +
  add_column applied in file order; renames/removals COUNTED in SchemaReport,
  not applied — an honestly-Inferred basis).
- **Run 2 (2026-07-06, redmine @ `bfd3c33a`, classic-fallback via ruff #48
  patched locally): GREEN — the bake STANDS.**
  - **E1 = 0.667 median coverage** over 342 (view,model) rows (506 ERB
    scanned, 240 views with hits) → **≥ 0.60: the ERB surface is
    mask-shaped; the bake stands.** The uncovered-reference census ships
    with the bake anyway (it is the render-side jitter codebook).
    *Transcription note:* the probe's doc-comment had mis-copied the stands
    bar as 0.80 (plan of record says 0.60 — this section, committed before
    any run). Recorded against both bars: stands@0.60, partial@0.80; the
    census ships either way, so the stricter reading's obligation is met.
  - **E2 = 1.00** — 244/244 non-wide rows: askama == bit-walk oracle, jinja
    witnessed OK. One probe-side parser bug found and fixed en route (the
    kit's `type` → `r#type` raw-ident escape; the KIT was correct, the
    probe's `pub <ident>:` reader wasn't stripping `r#`).
  - **E3 aggregate = 161 distinct masks / 333 views ≈ 0.48 < 0.5 → supports
    the Scope/route-dedup SoC claim**, concentrated exactly where it
    matters: Repository 0.22, Group 0.25, WikiContent 0.25, Project 0.29,
    Query 0.33, User 0.35, Wiki 0.38, CustomField 0.40, Tracker 0.44,
    Issue 0.47 all reuse hard; small classes (Board/Comment/Journal/Version
    = 1.00) trivially don't. "Routes are skins" is now a measurement, not
    doctrine, for leg 1.
  - Drift fuses pinned in the probe (content-signature-guarded on 506 ERB +
    ns=redmine): shape (240, 342), E1 band [0.60, 0.75), renderable rows
    244. Artifact parked at `.claude/harvest/redmine-view-bake/`
    (field_order.ndjson 61 models · masks.ndjson 342 rows · 5 samples).
  - Wide classes (>64 fields) recorded + render-skipped until OGAR #163's
    `render_class_with_methods_wide` is wired (OP work_packages leg).
- **Leg 2 (2026-07-06, op-corpus @ `46c1fda2`, OGAR post-#163 main): GREEN —
  L2-E1 partial, L2-E2 exact, CONV-1 partial.** Probe:
  `crates/op-codegen-pipeline/tests/render_bake_leg2_probe.rs`.
  - **L2-E1 = 0.429 median** over 52 mapped representer rows (104 files with
    declarations; 52 unmapped counted, never dropped) → **partial band
    [0.30, 0.60)**, and per the pre-reg note this IS the expected finding:
    representers declare a thick computed/link surface with no column
    (`derivedStartDate`, link rels, form helpers) — the uncovered census is
    the render-side jitter codebook, published in the artifact. Notably
    BELOW the ERB leg's 0.667: the "declarative" APIv3 surface projects
    *less* directly onto columns than 20-year-old ERB does.
  - **L2-E2 = 36/36** askama == bit-walk oracle, jinja witnessed OK (mask
    passed as hex string, `int(x,16)` — bigint-ready for the wide leg).
  - **WIDE SURPRISE:** zero wide rows — `WorkPackage` measured **40 fields**,
    not the expected ~109. Cause: the OP-layout schema reader consumes the
    `db/migrate/tables/*.rb` BASELINE only; post-baseline `add_column`
    migrations are not replayed. The wide path (`WideFieldMask` +
    `render_class_with_methods_wide`) is wired + property-verified (narrow
    hex degeneration) but not yet runtime-exercised on real wide data.
    Follow-up: teach the OP-layout path migration-replay (sibling of the
    classic fallback, ruff #48) — expected to push WorkPackage past 64 and
    light the wide leg for real.
  - **CONV-1 = 0.464 Jaccard → partial [0.25, 0.50): the disjoint census is
    the deliverable.** Intersection (13): author, category, created_at,
    description, done_ratio, due_date, id, priority, project, start_date,
    status, subject, updated_at. redmine_only (5): assigned_to,
    fixed_version, is_private, tracker, transition_warning. op_only (10):
    derived_done_ratio, duration, ignore_non_working_days, lock_version,
    project_phase_definition, responsible, schedule_manually, time_entries,
    type, version. Only 2/4 seeded renames applied — leg 1 stores
    association NAMES, so the `*_id` column renames never matched; **the
    census itself surfaces the association-level C4 v1 pairs
    (`tracker→type`, `fixed_version→version`)** — exactly the "C4 gap list
    IS the deliverable" outcome the pre-reg named. Informational only (NOT
    the pre-reg verdict): applying those two census-identified pairs would
    give ≈0.58 — a v1 CONV run may claim that ONLY under a fresh
    pre-registration; never retrofitted here.
  - Drift fuses pinned (corpus-signature-guarded, 104 decl-files +
    ns=openproject): shape (52, 36, 0 wide), L2-E1 band [0.30, 0.60),
    CONV-1 band [0.40, 0.55). Artifact parked at
    `.claude/harvest/op-representer-bake/` (field_order, masks, conv1.json,
    5 samples, README).
  - Verdict for the thesis: **"routes are skins" now measured on BOTH
    sides** (leg 1 E3 0.48 mask-reuse; leg 2 CONV-1 0.464 cross-app field
    convergence with the rename gap census in hand). The convergence claim
    is real but C4-gated — the full rename table is the next brick.
